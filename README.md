# Small projects
 A bunch of small project I did to introduce myself to different algorithms.


## Projects

### A* Algorithm
An implementation of the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid-based map. This project visualizes the pathfinding process using `pyamaze`.

### Huffman's Algorithm
A JavaScript implementation of Huffman's algorithm for lossless data compression.

### Iris Dataset Analysis
A project analyzing the Iris dataset using a Multiclass Perceptron Classifier and a One-vs-All Perceptron Classifier. 

### Levenshtein Algorithm
An implementation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm, calculating the minimum number of single-character edits required to transform one string into another. 

### Markov Decision Process
A project exploring Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to solve decision-making problems in stochastic environments. 

### Naive Bayes
An implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier for classification of handwritten digits (represented in .csv files).

### Prim's Algorithm
A demonstration of Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. This project includes a graphical representation.
